        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Our privacy policy explains what data we collect and how we use it during the recruitment process. It also tells you how you can access your data and update it if needed.</p>
        <p>At every step of the recruitment process, Travo Agency works hard to keep your personal data safe and secure. We are committed to providing a recruitment process that you can trust. We only collect the personal data we need to help you get a job with one of the cruise lines we partner with.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about our practices or policies, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@travo-agency.com">contact@travo-agency.com</a>. We will reply as soon as possible.</p>
        <h3>What personal data is collected?</h3>
        <p>Travo Agency collects only the personal data needed to give the companies we work with a clear picture of each candidate. The companies have strict and different hiring rules, and they may ask for specific personal data to make a hiring decision.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of the recruitment process, when we introduce qualified candidates to the companies, we may ask for personal data like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Name</li>
            <li>Address</li>
            <li>Contact details</li>
            <li>Email addresses</li>
            <li>Curriculum Vitae (CV)</li>
            <li>Date of Birth (some cruise lines require Food & Beverage candidates to be at least 21 years old to serve alcohol)</li>
            <li>Other data that might be required by one of the Companies we work with</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After you get a job offer, some companies may ask us to collect more personal data. This extra data is used to check references before confirming the job offer or to prepare you to join the company.</p>
        <p>In this final phase, after you have received a job offer from a company, we may ask for personal data like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Letters of reference</li>
            <li>Medical certificates</li>
            <li>Copies of diplomas and certificates</li>
            <li>Copies of ID documents</li>
            <li>Copies of criminal records</li>
            <li>Birth certificates</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What do we do with the data collected?</h3>
        <p>We only collect the personal data needed by the companies we work with, and we use this data only to help you get a job. To allow the companies to evaluate your professional profile, we need to share some of your personal data with them. So, some of the data you give us will be sent to the companies to help them make hiring decisions. We work only with reputable companies and believe they have strict privacy policies. We confirm that the personal data sent to them will be used only for recruitment purposes, not for commercial purposes.</p>
        <h3>How long do we keep your data?</h3>
        <p>We keep your personal data, like your CV and other documents, for one year from the day we receive them. After that, we delete your personal data from our server.</p>
        <p>The personal data we collect after you get a job offer will be kept for one month from the day we receive it. After that, we delete your personal data from our server.</p>
        <h3>Can you make changes to the data you sent us?</h3>
        <p>At any time during the recruitment process, you can contact Travo Agency to access or change your personal data, or ask us to delete it. You can do this by writing to <a href="mailto:contact@travo-agency.com">contact@travo-agency.com</a>.</p>
        <h3>How to contact us?</h3>
